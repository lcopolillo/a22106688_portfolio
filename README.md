# Portfolio I (In progress)

### !!! 
- This project is still in progress, which means I still have a lot of changes to make. 
- Some images are taken from the Unsplash website to improve the presentation;
- Some texts are in Latin so that there are no spaces to fill; 
- In general, the final design of the site will look like this, or very close to it. :)

### Introduction

Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Repository! Here, you can witness the evolution of my skills in Web Programming during my second year of Computer Engineering degree program. This website is designed to showcase my skills and projects that I have developed during my course. It is a dynamic and responsive website design.

To develop this website, I have applied the knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I have acquired during the second year of the course. In cases of doubt, I had the support of my teachers, and when necessary, I accessed internet resources such as W3Schools, DevDocs.io, among others.

In the first part (current), I have designed a template that defines the visuals of my application, worked on HTML, styling with CSS and some configuration with JavaScript. The pages can be easily accessed through a navigation menu, and they’re all structured.

The first part will be done until May 1st, stay tuned for updates!
